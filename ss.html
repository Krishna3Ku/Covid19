                    <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms as the virus runs its course.<br>Seek medical help if you think you have COVID-19. Your doctor will recommend treatment for any symptoms or complications that develop and let you know if you need to seek emergency treatment.<br>Other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are also treated by managing symptoms. In some cases, experimental treatments have been tested to see how effective they are.
Examples of therapies used for these illnesses include:<br>* antiviral or retroviral medications<br>* breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation<br>* steroids to reduce lung swelling<br>* blood plasma transfusions<br>

                    <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings

                    <p>Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.<br>
Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care providerâ€™s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.<br>If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:<br>If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)<br>1- have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities<br>2-If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart<br>3-Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members<br>4-Monitor your symptoms daily<br>5-Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy<br>6-If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately â€“ call them first if possible<br>7-Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.</p>

                    <p>Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms.<br>Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.<br>Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19.

                    <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In hospitals physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

                    <p>The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.<br>As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
